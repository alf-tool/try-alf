<h2>What?</h2>
<p>Alf is a modern query language. It is rooted in relational algebra, inspired
by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(data_language_specification)" target="_blank"><b>Tutorial D</b></a>
and
<a href="http://www.thethirdmanifesto.com/" target="_blank">The Third Manifesto</a>.</p>

<p>The tool is currently implemented as a Ruby Domain Specific Language (DSL).
It also comes with a nice commandline tool for using the algebra in shell
with a pipe-and-filter *nix philosophy.</p>

<p>Alf can query multiple and various sources of data, including but not restricted
to SQL databases. It has a smart compiler that delegates to the underlying engines what
can be delegated.</p>

<h2>Research questions</h2>

<p>Despite providing a nice tool for querying traditional data-bases, Alf aims
at investigating the following research questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How far can we use the closure property of relational algebra as an
      abstraction mechanism for software engineering? Do SQL engines support
      very complex query plans? How can logical query optimization help?</li>
  <li>Is modern relational algebra on top of a powerful type system enough to
      query multiple heterogeneous data sources? What connectors do we need?</li>
  <li>What high-level relational operators do software engineers invent if
      provided with a way to create their own?</li>
  <li>How do we truly reconcile multiple type systems when it comes to manipulating
      and passing data aound? e.g. Ruby (more generally a host language), SQL
      (an underlying database engine), JSON/XML (for data transfer), etc.</li>
  <li>Can we come with a pragmatic, intuitive, yet sound proposal for view
      updating on top of a well selected subset of relational operators?</li>
  <li>How well can we integrate (sound) query languages with host programming
      languages following a DSL approach?</li>
</ul>

<p>We are currently looking for collaborations within the academic world and
with industrial partners interrested in investing in this kind of approach.
Drop us an email if interrested.</p>
