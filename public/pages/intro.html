<h1>How to learn Alf?</h1>

<p>This documentation comes with a lot of examples that you can try online. This
is probably one of the most efficient ways to learn. More specifically, here
is a possible roadmap:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start with the documentation of a relational operator,</li>
<li>Try the examples, play with them,</li>
<li>Read the description and implementation notes,</li>
<li>Try to understand the definitions when an operator can be defined in terms
of other operators. Those definitions use the closure property of relational
algebra a lot. From there, jump to another operator.</li>
<li>If needed, have a look at predicates and other concepts to better understand
the language and operator signatures.</li>
</ul>

<p>The query language aims at being as intuitive as possible, even if some
background is definitely needed. Two main directions here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure to eventually read the <a href="/doc/pages/relational-basics">relational
basics</a>.</li>
<li>If you do not know ruby, make sure to eventually read the <a href="/doc/pages/ruby-basics">ruby
basics</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h1>How to get started outside of try-alf.org ?</h1>

<p>Alf comes as a ruby gem. You need ruby &gt;= 1.9.3.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">alf</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">sqlite3</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">pg</span><span class="o">]</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>Once installed, the command line tool is available:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">alf</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">help</span>
<span class="n">alf</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">examples</span> <span class="n">show</span> <span class="n">suppliers</span>
<span class="n">alf</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">db</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;postgres://user:password@host/database&quot;</span> <span class="n">show</span> <span class="n">tablename</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>Have a look at the <a href="/doc/pages/alf-in-ruby">Alf in Ruby</a> and <a href="/doc/pages/alf-in-shell">Alf in
Shell</a> pages for getting started depending on the
kind of context in which you plan to use it.</p>
